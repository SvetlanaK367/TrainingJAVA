=======================
	Hadoop got its start in Nutch. A few of us were attempting to build an open source web
search engine and having trouble managing computations running on even a handful of
computers. Once Google published its GFS and MapReduce papers, the route became
clear. They would devised systems to solve precisely the problems we were having with Nutch.
So we started, two of us, half-time, to try to re-create these systems as a part of Nutch.
	We managed to get Nutch limping along on 20 machines, but it soon became clear that to
handle the Web massive scale, we would need to run it on thousands of machines, and
moreover, that the job was bigger than two half-time developers could handle.
	Around that time, Yahoo got interested, and quickly put together a team that I joined. We
split off the distributed computing part of Nutch, naming it Hadoop. With the help of
Yahoo, Hadoop soon grew into a technology that could truly scale to the Web.
